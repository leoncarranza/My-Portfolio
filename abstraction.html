    <h1>Abstraction</h1>
    <p>	In my AP Computer Science Principles class, I was introduced to the concept of abstraction: the notion that someone can interface with a device without having to understand its inner workings. As someone who avidly plays games on my Nintendo Switch, I began to realize that I know how to operate its software, but nothing about its hardware.
	Intrigued by how abstraction pervades my life, I decided to draw the system dismantled with its parts presented in layers. I used a straightedge to draw lines that established the perspective I would be drawing each component in. After watching numerous console breakdown videos, I had an intuition for its layout, and was able to arbitrarily draw circuit boards in pen. I used graphite to provide more shading to the controllers on top. I believe this distinguishes the controllers as what we perceive the Switch to be, and the solid-lined wiring as what the device truly is.

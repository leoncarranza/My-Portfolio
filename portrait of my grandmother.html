    <h1>Portrait of My Grandmother</h1>
    <p>After her recent passing, I decided to paint a portrait of my grandmother on my motherâ€™s side.
I used a photo of her at a wedding as reference. However, since the photo only showed up to her shoulders, I added a white dress and included more of her body in order to better frame the portrait.
With an emphasis on facial and neck proportions, I lightly sketched on the canvas with a pencil. I then started blocking in the midtones of her skin and hair with oil paint. After it dried, I began to paint the highlights and shades, avoiding the space that would be her white dress. I would eventually add grays to give the cloth subtle creases.
The gentle green background helped to contrast and balance out the warm colors that made up her face. The slightly brighter green that surrounds the face helps to make it central to the final composition.

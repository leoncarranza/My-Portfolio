    <h1>Teen Arts Festival 2019 Cover</h1>
    <p>My graphic design class participates in an annual contest to design the cover of the brochure for the following yearâ€™s Bergen County Teen Arts Festival. The piece is required to be black and white. Instrumental music, singing, dancing, film, creative writing, and the visual arts are the art genres that need to be represented in the illustration.
	In 2018, this piece was chosen to be the cover of the 2019 brochure. Through the Procreate app on my iPad. Having recently learned the principles of positive and negative space in my graphic design class, I strove to implement it in my piece. I started with large shapes that defined the overall composition, such as the central figure, the banner containing the title, and the spaces in between them. I then added objects within these spaces that represented each genre of art.
	I believe the piece has a centrality to it that was supplemented by the initial outlining of symmetrical shapes.

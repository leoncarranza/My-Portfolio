    <h1> Sky Next to Me</h1>
    <p>	I often walk along the Hudson River walkway over the summer. I enjoy looking at clouds in the blue summer sky since it gives me a feeling of peacefulness. On this part of the river that I depicted in my work, there is an abandoned golf course with netting poles that still remain. I became interested in how these poles interact with the sky and clouds, and decided to paint two pieces that depict this relationship. Both paintings are based on what can be seen on either side of the course.
	I challenged myself to only used blue and white acrylic paint, with a hint of purple. I started by filling each canvas with blue acrylic paint, then used white paint to add clouds. I then used a mix of blue and white paint to depict the poles, and the objects beyond them that can be seen from each perspective.
	Although I did not plan for interconnectivity, I believe the cloud that begins in the left piece and ends on the right emphasizes the relationship they have.

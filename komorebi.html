    <h1>Komorebi</h1>
    <p>Through “Komorebi,” I intended to convey a message that no matter how difficult our lives get, things will be okay. By drawing a modern urban world in ruins, I wanted to represent the destruction of what we believe to be essential to our lives. However, I littered symbols of nature such as trees and other overgrown greenery to communicate that life can still be beautiful if the world as we know it were to end. I used pens to illustrate the city and trees.
	“Komorebi” is a Japanese word that describes the light that filters through trees. By using black watercolor to shade my piece, I shaded the ground and leaves with this phenomenon in mind.
	The final piece has a particular weight to it that leads the viewer across the page. The eyes are led from an area filled with buildings into an area densely populated with trees. This contrast between the modern world and nature helps to convey my message.

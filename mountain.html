    <h1>Mountain</h1>
    <p>Over spring break, I visited Mauna Kea, the mountain on Hawaii’s main island. Standing on the summit above the clouds was breathtaking and took my mind off of my anxieties about school. I thought about how small I was next to this mountain that will exist for thousands of years. In this piece, I wanted to communicate both a sense of scale, and that the cold winds on the mountain’s summit made it seem like a living thing.
In the lower middle, I drew a figure that is small in comparison to the mountain. Drawing lines of confidence was again crucial to what I wished to convey in this piece; I used ink pens to create clouds out of non-intersecting lines. This was done to create both a sense of directionality and liveliness within the mountain.
The contrast between the straight lines on the mountain and the curves of the clouds combine to create a final piece that feels dynamic and lively.

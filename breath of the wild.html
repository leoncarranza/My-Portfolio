    <h1>Breath of the Wild</h1>
    <p>I am a long-time fan of Zelda games. Breath of the Wild, the first title from the franchise to be on the Nintendo Switch, distinguishes itself in my mind for its serene tone. In this piece, I aimed to emphasize how the game uses nature to create a sense of calmness.
	In-game, I was riding a horse through a river as a rainbow appeared. I used this experience as inspiration for my piece. I used Procreateâ€™s watercolor brushes to create the background. For the closer objects, such as the water and the figure on the horse, I used a thicker brush to paint.
	The smudged, hazy background ultimately gives the piece a sense of depth. The viewer focuses more on the character and the horse, as well as the ripples of water.

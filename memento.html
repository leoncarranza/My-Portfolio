    <h1>Memento</h1>
    <p>This is an illustration of a block facing 14th Street Union Square in New York City with ink. I titled it “Memento” because I used to visit the Pret a Manger cafe depicted in the piece every Saturday for breakfast, and this is how I want it to be remembered.
I used a speedball pen and a bottle of black ink to draw the final product. I used a smaller nib to better articulate the overhangs and facades of the buildings in my piece.
I chose to represent the street appear as a flowing river to convey the chaos of vehicles and pedestrians without detracting from the structures I wanted to emphasize.
I believe this piece reflects a growth in my artistic style; I aimed to use confident, long, and unbroken strokes to articulate the details in my piece, and this shows in the outcome and in my later pieces.

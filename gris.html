    <h1>Gris</h1>
    <p>Having recently finished the game Gris, I aimed to do a freehand sketch of the titular character. I focused on making her hair and clothing appear dynamic through line in order to parallel her emotional turmoil and growth throughout the game.
	I started with the face and hands, as they would act as the simple solid shapes that my linework would later build upon. I utilized intricate, flowing movements within Gris' cloak and hair to represent the inner turmoil that results from the characterâ€™s initial loss of a loved one. I chose not to sketch these lines in pencil beforehand, opting instead to draw ink directly on in order to focus on the emotion I was trying to convey through the lines.
	The contrast between the flowing lines that shape the hair and the cloak and the solid outlines ties the final piece together compositionally and helps to emphasize how this game emotionally impacted me.
